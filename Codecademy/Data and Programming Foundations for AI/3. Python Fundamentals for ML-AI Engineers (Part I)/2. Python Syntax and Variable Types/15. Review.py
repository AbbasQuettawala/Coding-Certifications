In this lesson, we accomplished a lot of things! We instructed our computers to print messages, we stored these messages as 
Preview: Docs A variable is used to store data that will be used by the program. This data can be a number, a string, a Boolean, a list or some other data type. Every variable has a name which can consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore character . The equal sign = is used to assign a value to a variable. After the initial assignment is made, the value of a variable can be updated to new values as needed. A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, grade, grocerylist). Rules for Python variables: - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. It cannot start with a number. - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _). - Variable names are case-sensitive (num, Num, and NUM are three different variables).

Good job!

Preview: Docs Python is a general-purpose, versatile, and powerful programming language. It’s a great first language because it’s concise and easy to read. Whatever you want to do, Python can do it. From data analysis to data visualization, web development to machine learning, Python is the language for you. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and was named after the British comedy show, Monty Pythons Flying Circus.
