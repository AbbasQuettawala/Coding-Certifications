To build control flow in our program, we need to be able to check whether a condition is true or not. For this, we use Boolean expressions.

A Boolean expression is a statement that can either be true or false. The statement must be answered by true or false only, and it must be verifiable with evidence. It cannot rely on interpretation or opinion.

To understand this, let’s go back to the ‘waking up’ example. The first question, “Is today a weekday?” can be written as a Boolean expression shown below:

Today is a weekday.

This expression can be true - if today is Tuesday, for example - or false if it’s a weekend. There are no other options, we know the answer is verifiable, and it does not rely on an opinion.

Now, consider the following phrase:

Friday is the best day of the week.

Copy to Clipboard

Is this a Boolean expression?

No, this statement is an opinion and is subjective. Someone might say that “Wednesday is the best day.” and their statement would be no less true or false than the one above.

How about the following phrase:

Sunday starts with the letter 'C.' 

Copy to Clipboard

Yes, this is a Boolean expression since the answer can only be true or false and it is verifiable. Even though the statement itself is false (Sunday starts with the letter ‘S’ and not ‘C’), it is still a Boolean expression.

Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Enabled
1.
Examine the following statement.

The Earth revolves around the Sun.

Copy to Clipboard

If you think it’s a Boolean statement, set the variable first_statement to "Yes". Else, set it to "No".

Checkpoint 2 Step instruction is unavailable until previous steps are completed
2.
Now, consider the following statement.

The Moon is made of cheese.

Copy to Clipboard

If you think it’s a Boolean statement, create a variable second_statement and set it to "Yes". Otherwise, set it to "No".

Checkpoint 3 Step instruction is unavailable until previous steps are completed
3.
Next, consider the following statement.

Chocolate ice cream tastes better than vanilla.

Copy to Clipboard

If the statement qualifies as a Boolean expression, initialize a variable third_statement to "Yes". If it doesn’t, initialize the variable third_statement to "No".
"""

first_statement = "Yes"

second_statement = "Yes"

third_statement = "No"
