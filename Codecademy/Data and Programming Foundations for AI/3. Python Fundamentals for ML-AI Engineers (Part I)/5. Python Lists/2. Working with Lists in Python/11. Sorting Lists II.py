It generates a new list rather than modifying the one that already exists.
Letâ€™s return to our list of names:

names = ["Xander", "Buffy", "Angel", "Willow", "Giles"]

Copy to Clipboard

Using sorted(), we can create a new list, called sorted_names:

sorted_names = sorted(names)
print(sorted_names)

Copy to Clipboard

This yields the list sorted alphabetically:

['Angel', 'Buffy', 'Giles', 'Willow', 'Xander']

Copy to Clipboard

Note that using sorted did not change names:

print(names)

Copy to Clipboard

Would output:

['Xander', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Willow', 'Giles']
