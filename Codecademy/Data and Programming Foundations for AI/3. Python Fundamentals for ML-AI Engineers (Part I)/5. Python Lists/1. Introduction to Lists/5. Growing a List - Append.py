We can add a single element to a list using the 
Preview: Docs Adds an item to end of the list.
.append()
 Python method.

Suppose we have an empty list called garden:

garden = []

Copy to Clipboard

We can add the element "Tomatoes" by using the .append() method:

garden.append("Tomatoes")

print(garden)

Copy to Clipboard

Will output:

['Tomatoes']

Copy to Clipboard

We see that garden now contains "Tomatoes"!

When we use .append() on a list that already has elements, our new element is added to the end of the list:

# Create a list
garden = ["Tomatoes", "Grapes", "Cauliflower"]

# Append a new element
garden.append("Green Beans")
print(garden)

Copy to Clipboard

Will output:

['Tomatoes', 'Grapes', 'Cauliflower', 'Green Beans']

Copy to Clipboard

Letâ€™s use the .append() method to manipulate a list.
