"""
A dictionary doesn’t have to contain anything. Sometimes we need to create an empty dictionary when we plan to fill it later based on some other input.

We can create an empty dictionary like this:

empty_dict = {}

Copy to Clipboard

We will explore ways to fill a dictionary in the next exercise.
