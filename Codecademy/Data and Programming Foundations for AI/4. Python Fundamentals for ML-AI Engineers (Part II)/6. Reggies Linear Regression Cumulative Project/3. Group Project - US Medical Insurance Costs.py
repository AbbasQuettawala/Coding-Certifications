You can learn a lot on your own, but you can learn even more when you collaborate with others!

Group Projects in the Data Scientist Path
As part of this Career Path, you will have the opportunity to connect with other learners to practice and apply your new skills. This is optional! We will sometimes prompt you to work with peers, but you should feel free to work with others as often as you like to gain practice!

How to Conduct a Group Project
Step One – Understand the Project
Select what you would like to work on together. We suggest U.S. Medical Insurance Costs, which will help you to collaborate on a Python project using real-world data. Alternatively, come up with your own project that uses Python.

Assess the prompt or project requirements:

What technical skill sets do you need to complete the project? Will you need data analysis, data engineering, visualization and subject matter expertise?
How advanced a skillset in each is required and how much work is there to go around?
From here you’ll know which roles your project needs and how many people are necessary. Your project may only need one other person or could have four or more collaborators, depending on the size and complexity of the project.

Step Two – Find Your Teammates
Find collaborators! Visit the projects forum. You can also find collaborators in the data-science channel in Codecademy’s Discord server. If still looking for others to work with, check out the Codecademy Facebook group, in a Codecademy Chapter, or at local meetups.

When you arrive, be sure to introduce yourself with the following information:

What % of the path you have completed
What timezone or country you’re in
A link to your Codecademy Profile
One fun fact about yourself
Step Three – Build Your Team
Now that you’ve found people to work with, the next step is to figure out how each of you would like to contribute to this project.

These are some different roles that you and your teammates could take. Also, one person can have more than one role and more than one person could have the same role.

Product Manager who also codes. This person makes decisions about what features will be built and in which order. Data Science Product Managers keep the team organized and on track to be sure everything gets done. To learn a lot more about being a team leader, please see this post.
Data Engineer. This person manages the data, making sure it is clean, reliable, and accessible. This role typically maintains the data standards and ensures consistency across a project.
Data Scientist. This person draws on one or more data sets to generate insights, and uses hypothesis testing to answer questions. They may create visualizations, conduct exploratory analyses, or use summary statistics to describe data. They may also use predictive statistics and machine learning to make predictions from the data.
Subject Matter Expert who also codes. This person situates datasets within their real-world context to ensure that the team is asking the right questions and interpreting the results accurately.

Step Four – Get to Work
Get to it! Have a kick-off meeting, ideally over a video chat platform, so you can all meet one another and discuss the project.

Remember that if and when you get stuck, you can lean on each other in order to get through problems. In the real world, analysts troubleshoot their own work first with tried and true methods, but they often ask teammates for help too. If your teammates can’t help, reach out in the forums or in the Discord server.

Sometimes, life happens. Even in the “real world” workplace, people get sick or leave projects. If a learner leaves and you need a replacement, post in the Discord server and the community will try to help you out.

Step Five – Share!
If you completed the U.S. Medical Insurance Costs Project, share it with fellow learners on its forum page. If you choose to do another project, post your project in the Projects category and share it with the other learners in the forums or on Discord! Getting feedback is a vital part of the development process and in growing your skills. Remember to give back to other people wanting feedback or guidance, not just because it’s a good thing to do, but you’ll also benefit by explaining to others what you’ve learned.

If you’re feeling generous, don’t just share your work but share your insights and guidance for the next team tackling something similar. Paying it forward and giving back is how the developer world works – entire systems have been built this way.
