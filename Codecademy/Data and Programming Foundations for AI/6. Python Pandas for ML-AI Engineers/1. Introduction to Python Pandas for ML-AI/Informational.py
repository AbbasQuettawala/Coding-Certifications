Preview the power of pandas and all that you will learn in this unit.

Welcome, this is the unit where you will go from programming to analyzing data to really using Python to work with data like a pro. Pandas is at the center of a lot of data-related work. The important thing about the pandas library is an object called a DataFrame. You will work with a lot of DataFrames during this course, but even more in your career.

You can think of a DataFrame as a kind of table, similar to an Excel spreadsheet, but much more powerful. We’ll save the rest of the introduction for the lessons, but you should know that the more you learn about pandas, the easier your work will be.

What will you learn?
In this unit, you will start building proficiency in the pandas library, which is essential for working with data in Python.

After this course, you will be able to:

Load, modify, and analyze a DataFrame
Transform a Series of data
Leverage lambda expressions to write custom programs to manipulate your DataFrames
Perform SQL-like functions on multiple DataFrames
Why is this important?
Pandas is at the center of a lot of the work in a Machine Learning workflow, and will be an invaluable tool in your skillset as you work with more data and models. Pandas lets you work with data in a way that nothing else can, and will be a powerful tool in your toolbelt.

Where do I find other classmates?
The Forums!

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.
