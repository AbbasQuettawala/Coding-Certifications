"""
You practiced basic lambda function syntax like:

add_two = lambda my_input: my_input+2


as well as more complicated lambda functions with if/else statements like:

check_if_A_grade = lambda grade: 'Got an A!' if grade >= 90 else 'Did not get an A...'


Also, along the way you practiced these core Python concepts:

Strings and substrings
Getting characters from strings
Mathematical operations
Comparators
Random integers
Good job!
