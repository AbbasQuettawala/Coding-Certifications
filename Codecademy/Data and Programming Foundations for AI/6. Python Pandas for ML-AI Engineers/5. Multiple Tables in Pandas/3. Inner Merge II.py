"""
It is easy to do this kind of matching for one row, but hard to do it for multiple rows.

Luckily, Pandas can efficiently do this for the entire table. We use the .merge() method.

The .merge() method looks for columns that are common between two DataFrames and then looks for rows where those columnâ€™s values are the same. It then combines the matching rows into a single row in a new table.

We can call the pd.merge() method with two tables like this:

new_df = pd.merge(orders, customers)


This will match up all of the customer information to the orders that each customer made.
