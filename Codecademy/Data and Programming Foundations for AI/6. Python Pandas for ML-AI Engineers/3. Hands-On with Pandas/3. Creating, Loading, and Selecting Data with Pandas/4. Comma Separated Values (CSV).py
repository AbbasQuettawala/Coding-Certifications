We now know how to create our own DataFrame. However, most of the time, we’ll be working with datasets that already exist. One of the most common formats for big datasets is the CSV.

CSV (comma separated values) is a text-only spreadsheet format. You can find CSVs in lots of places:

Online datasets (here’s an example from data.gov)
Export from Excel or Google Sheets
Export from SQL
The first row of a CSV contains column headings. All subsequent rows contain values. Each column heading and each variable is separated by a comma:

column1,column2,column3
value1,value2,value3


That example CSV represents the following table:

column1	column2	column3
value1	value2	value3
