We can also add a new column that is the same for all rows in the DataFrame. Letâ€™s return to our inventory example:

Product ID	Product Description	Cost to Manufacture	Price
1	3 inch screw	0.50	0.75
2	2 inch nail	0.10	0.25
3	hammer	3.00	5.50
4	screwdriver	2.50	3.00

Suppose we know that all of our products are currently in-stock. We can add a column that says this:

df['In Stock?'] = True


Now all of the rows have a column called In Stock? with value True.

Product ID	Product Description	Cost to Manufacture	Price	In Stock?
1	3 inch screw	0.50	0.75	True
2	2 inch nail	0.10	0.25	True
3	hammer	3.00	5.50	True
4	screwdriver	2.50	3.00	True

Add a column to df called Is taxed?, which indicates whether or not to collect sales tax on the product. It should be 'Yes' for all rows.
