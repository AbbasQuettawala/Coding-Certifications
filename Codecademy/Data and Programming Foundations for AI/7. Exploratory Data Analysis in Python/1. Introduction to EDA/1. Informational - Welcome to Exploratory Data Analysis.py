Welcome to Exploratory Data Analysis
Explorating your data is the first step to understanding it. Preview what you will learn in Exploratory Data Analysis.

Welcome to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is an essential step in the Data Science process, and establishes the foundation for your data science projects. What you learn during EDA will determine what kinds of analysis you can do, and what models you can build.

Sometimes, the results of EDA are the answers to the questions you are asking. Questions about what the data shows are often questions of Summary Statistics, which are part of EDA. So, becoming fluent in when to look at the mean vs. the median of a dataset or when the range vs. the inter-quartile range is the best answer will be essential on your data science journey.

In this unit, we will introduce the essential techniques, most popular tools, and things you should look out for when exploring your data for the first (or the 50th) time.

What will you learn?
In this unit, you will start building proficiency with summary statistics and variable types.

After this course, you will be able to:

Identify different variable types
Determine what kinds of analysis are appropriate based on the variable type
Summarize a single variable
Summarize the relationship between two variables
Inspect and clean a dataset.
Why is this important?
Exploratory Data Analysis is an essential tool for everyone working with data. Developing fluency with summary statistics and variable types will make it easier to answer questions about data and decide what kinds of analysis can be run and what types of models can be built.

Where do I find other classmates?
The Forums!

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.
