variables
. Although we used binary variables (only 2 options per category), it is important to note that the same techniques can be used for non-binary categorical variables. The methods we used in this lesson included:

Contingency tables of frequencies
Contingency tables of proportions
Marginal proportions
Expected contingency tables
The Chi-Square statistic
Note that the data in this lesson was downloaded from Kaggle, then cleaned and subsetted. The data was originally collected and made public by the Open-Source Psychometrics Project.

Instructions
As a final exercise, the NPI dataset has been loaded for you once more in script.py as npi. Remember that the columns are defined as follows:

influence: yes = I have a natural talent for influencing people; no = I am not good at influencing people.
blend_in: yes = I prefer to blend in with the crowd; no = I like to be the center of attention.
special: yes = I think I am a special person; no = I am no better or worse than most people.
leader: yes = I see myself as a good leader; no = I am not sure if I would make a good leader.
authority: yes = I like to have authority over other people; no = I donâ€™t mind following orders.
Which other pairs of questions might be associated (or not)? Use the workspace and your newfound skills to investigate for yourself!
