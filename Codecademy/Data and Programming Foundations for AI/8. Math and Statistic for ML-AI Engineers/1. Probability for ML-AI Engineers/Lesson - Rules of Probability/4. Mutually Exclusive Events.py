Two events are considered mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. For example, consider a single coin flip: the events “tails” and “heads” are mutually exclusive because we cannot get both tails and heads on a single flip.

We can visualize two mutually exclusive events as a pair of non-overlapping circles. They do not overlap because there is no outcome for one event that is also in the sample space for the other:

A Venn diagram that shows two non-overlapping circles, one that represents event A and one that represents event B. Nothing is shaded in the Venn diagram.

What about events that are not mutually exclusive? If event A is rolling an odd number and event B is rolling a number greater than two, these events are not mutually exclusive. They have an intersection of {3, 5}. Any events that have a non-empty intersection are not mutually exclusive.

In quiz.py we have the following variables: events_1, events_2, and events_3. Given the two events outlined in these exercises, fill in the variables as either "mutually exclusive" or "not mutually exclusive".

We have a bag of five marbles: three are green and two are blue. Suppose that we pick one marble from the bag. Event A is that the marble is green. Event B is that the marble is blue. Are these events mutually exclusive?

Fill your answer in the events_1 variable where it says "insert answer here". After filling out your answer in quiz.py, hit run.

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
We roll a die once. Event A is rolling an odd number. Event B is rolling a number greater than four. Are these events mutually exclusive?

Fill your answer in the events_2 variable where it says "insert answer here". After filling out your answer in quiz.py, hit run.

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
We roll a die once. Event A is rolling an even number. Event B is rolling a number less than two. Are these events mutually exclusive?

Fill your answer in the events_3 variable where it says "insert answer here". After filling out your answer in quiz.py, hit run.
