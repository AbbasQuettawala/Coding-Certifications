Let’s dive into some key concepts we will use throughout this lesson: union, intersection, and complement.

Union
The union of two sets encompasses any element that exists in either one or both of them. We can represent this visually as a Venn diagram.

A Venn diagram that shows two overlapping circles, one that represents event A and one that represents event B. Both of these circles are shaded blue.

For example, let’s say we have two sets, A and B. A represents rolling an odd number with a six-sided die (the set {1, 3, 5}). B represents rolling a number greater than two (the set {3, 4, 5, 6}). The union of these two sets would be everything in either set A, set B, or both: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We can write the union of two events mathematically as (A or B).

Intersection
The intersection of two sets encompasses any element that exists in both of the sets. Visually:

A Venn diagram that shows two overlapping circles, one that represents event A and one that represents event B. Only the overlap of the two circles is shaded.

The intersection of the above sets (A represents rolling an odd number on a six-sided die and B represents rolling a number greater than two) includes any value that appears in both sets: {3, 5}. We can write the intersection of two events mathematically as (A and B).

Complement
Lastly, the complement of a set consists of all possible outcomes outside of the set. Visually:

A Venn diagram that shows a circle representing event A. Everything outside of event A is shaded blue.

Consider set A from the above example (rolling an odd number on a 6-sided die). The complement of this set would be rolling an even number: {2, 4, 6}. We can write the complement of set A as AC. One key feature of complements is that a set and its complement cover the entire sample space. In this die roll example, the set of even numbers and odd numbers would cover all possible rolls: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Instructions
To the right is an applet that shows two overlapping circles: A and B. The two dropdown menus allow you to choose from different events. Event A can be any of the following:

The outcome of a die roll is even
The outcome of a die roll is a five
The outcome of a die roll is less than or equal to three
Event B can be any of the following:

The outcome of a die roll is odd
The outcome of a die roll is anything but five
The outcome of a die roll is greater than or equal to two
Using the applet, find the intersection and union between the following two events:

The outcome of a die roll is less than or equal to three
The outcome of a die roll is anything but five
Using the applet, find the complement of the following events:

The outcome of a die roll is greater than or equal to two
The outcome of a die roll is five
Feel free to play around with it more!
