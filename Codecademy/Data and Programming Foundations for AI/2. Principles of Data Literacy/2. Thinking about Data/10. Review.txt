variables
 can be described with frequencies and proportions.
Numeric variables can be described using measures of center and spread.
Sometimes we need robust statistics like the median and IQR because our data is skewed or has outliers.
We can aggregate data to get a look at relationships between pairs of variables.
Scatter plots and correlation coefficients help us describe linear relationships between pairs of numeric variables.
And hopefully, the most important discovery you made is that learning statistics doesn’t have to be a struggle. We gain valuable skills just by understanding some basic concepts. Enjoy using your new data vocabulary!
