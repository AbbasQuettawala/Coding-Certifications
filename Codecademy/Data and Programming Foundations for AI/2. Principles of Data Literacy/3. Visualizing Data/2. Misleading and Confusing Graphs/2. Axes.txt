Axes and scaling are like the page layout and spacing of a paper book: they’re not the most exciting parts, but they do present plenty of opportunities to make it harder to read.

Let’s start with axes – the x-axis (horizontal, left-right) and y-axis (vertical, top-bottom). A common misleading aspect of an axis is a break. A break starts the count at a number that’s not zero, or jumps ahead – this can distort the amount of difference between data points by removing context, and make small differences in data seem bigger.

Here’s an illustration of that idea: it would be almost impossible to tell at a glance if there were 100, 105, or 110 people standing in a room – but you’d be able to easily tell the difference between 0, 5, and 10 people standing in a room. Using a break on an axis can have the same effect, amplifying the change rather than the context because it alters the proportions in the visualization. Check out the

 to the right to see what this looks like in practice.

So what to do? If you’re looking at a graph, take a second to check where the axis starts. If there’s a break, factor that in as you think about what the numbers mean.

If you’re making the graph, instead of using a big break…

Keep enough context to view differences in proportion to a meaningful amount, OR
Make two graphs, one without a break and one “zoomed in”, OR
Choose a visualization type that shows the change, rather than the raw numbers
